## Differences between React and React Native

* What is a **React**?
  - **React** combines the real and the virtual environments to give real-world experience through computer generated data

  - Features
    - **JSX** stands for JavaScript XML. Its an XML/HTML like syntax used by React
    - **Virtual DOM** is a node tree that lists the elements and their attributes and content as Object and their properties.

    - **Testability** React views can be used as functions of the state
    - **Server-side rendering**
    - In **One-way data binding**, data flows in a single directions
      ie. from the models to the views.

    - **Simplicity** JSX makes it **simple** and **easy** to create applications.

* What is a **React Native**?
  - **React Native** is a cross-platform mobile application development framework that uses JavaScript as its base language

  - Features
    - **Write once use everywhere** is the base feature of React Native.

    - **React Native** makes use of **JavaScript** which is one of the most popular and widely used web development languages
    - React Native has a diverse **community** that even hosts international meet-ups.
    - React Native allows you to add **plugins** and third part packages.
    - React Native's **live reload** feature allows you to modify the code as well as the modifications simultaneously.
    - React Native allows **cost efficient testing** using tools such as Jest, etc.

* **React** vs **React Native**

| :---:                 | ---                                                                               | ---                   |
| Applications          | Web Applications                                                                  | Mobile Applications   |
| Setup and Bundling    | **React** requireds multiple tools for setup and bundling                         | **React Native** comes with all the essentials required to build the application  |
| Live reload           | **React** does not support live reload feature                                    | **React Native** comes with live reload feature   |
| Template Rendering    | **React** comparatively better in styling the applications                        | **React Native** uses Native platform APIs for styling    |
| Learning Curve        | **React** is not very difficult to learn but you will need to code the components | **React Native** very easy to learn as everything is readily available    |
